These are laws you should be aware of and not become entangled in. Hacking is covered under the **U.S. Code Title 18**: Crimes and Criminal Procedure: Part 1: Crimes: Chapter 47: Fraud and False State- ments: Sections 1029 and 1030.

## Section 1029, _Fraud and Related Activity with Access Devices_

This law gives the U.S. government the power to prosecute hackers.

## Section 1030, _Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers_

The law covers just about any computer or device connected to a network or the Internet.

## Electronic Communications Privacy Act

## Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

## The Cyber Security Enhancement Act of 2002

This act mandates that hackers who carry out certain computer crimes might now get life sentences in prison if the crime could result in anotherâ€™s bodily harm or possible death. This means that if hackers disrupt a 911 system, they could spend the rest of their days in prison.

## The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001

Originally passed because of the World Trade Center attack on September 11, 2001, this act strengthens computer crime laws and has been the subject of some controversy. It gives the U.S. government extreme latitude in pursuing criminals. The act permits the U.S. government to monitor hackers without a warrant and perform sneak-and-peek searches.

## The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

This act was signed into law in 2002 as part of the E-Government Act of 2002, replac- ing the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA).
